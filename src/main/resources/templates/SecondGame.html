    How to play the second game?<br>
    <br>
    In this game you fight with your ship against enemy ships.<br>
    Your ship has shields, armor, health, and attack attributes.<br>
    If you press <span class="highlight">All hands, open fire!</span> button, both ships will attack each other, each attack will decrease health or shields.<br>
    If you want to destroy the enemy ship, first you have to decrease shields to 0, then you must decrease health to 0.<br>
    When damaging shields, you cause full damage with your ship.<br>
    When damaging health, your damage is decreased by armor value.<br>
    If you press <span class="highlight">Brace for impact!</span> button, both ships will also attack each other, but your ship will only suffer 50% of the damage inflicted, while its own attack power will be reduced by 70%.<br>
    Each time you destroy an enemy ship, your ship will be upgraded. <br>
    Your attributes will be upgraded, and the picture of your ship will also change.<br>
    But the enemy ship will also be upgraded, so each time you will face a stronger enemy ship.<br>
    There are also skill points that can be used for upgrading your ship.<br>
    You can use them if you have enough points to purchase an upgrade.<br>
    You start with some skill points, and for each destroyed ship, you will gain some more.<br>
    If you manage to destroy all enemy ships, you have won.
